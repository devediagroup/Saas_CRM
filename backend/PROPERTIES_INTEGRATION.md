# Properties Integration with Projects and Developers

## üéØ **Overview**

The Properties module has been enhanced to integrate with the new Projects and Developers entities, creating a comprehensive real estate management system.

## üîó **New Relationships**

### **Property Entity Updates**
- Added `project_id` (UUID, nullable) - Links property to a specific project
- Added `developer_id` (UUID, nullable) - Links property to a specific developer
- Added `project` relation - Many-to-One with Project entity
- Added `developer` relation - Many-to-One with Developer entity

### **Relationship Flow**
```
Company (1) ‚Üí (Many) Developers
Company (1) ‚Üí (Many) Projects  
Developer (1) ‚Üí (Many) Projects
Project (1) ‚Üí (Many) Properties
Property (Many) ‚Üí (1) Project, Developer
```

## üöÄ **New API Endpoints**

### **1. Get Properties by Project**
```http
GET /properties/by-project/:projectId
```
- Returns all properties belonging to a specific project
- Includes project and developer relations
- Filtered by company (multi-tenancy)

### **2. Get Properties by Developer**
```http
GET /properties/by-developer/:developerId
```
- Returns all properties developed by a specific developer
- Includes project and developer relations
- Filtered by company (multi-tenancy)

### **3. Get Properties by Project and Developer**
```http
GET /properties/by-project-and-developer/:projectId/:developerId
```
- Returns properties that belong to both a specific project and developer
- Useful for filtering properties with multiple criteria
- Filtered by company (multi-tenancy)

## üìù **Updated DTOs**

### **CreatePropertyDto**
```typescript
{
  // ... existing fields
  project_id?: string;      // Optional project association
  developer_id?: string;    // Optional developer association
}
```

### **UpdatePropertyDto**
```typescript
{
  // ... existing fields
  project_id?: string;      // Optional project association
  developer_id?: string;    // Optional developer association
}
```

## üîß **Service Methods**

### **New Methods in PropertiesService**

#### **getPropertiesByProject**
```typescript
async getPropertiesByProject(
  companyId: string, 
  projectId: string
): Promise<Property[]>
```

#### **getPropertiesByDeveloper**
```typescript
async getPropertiesByDeveloper(
  companyId: string, 
  developerId: string
): Promise<Property[]>
```

#### **getPropertiesByProjectAndDeveloper**
```typescript
async getPropertiesByProjectAndDeveloper(
  companyId: string,
  projectId: string,
  developerId: string
): Promise<Property[]>
```

### **Enhanced Existing Methods**
- `findAll()` - Now includes project and developer relations
- `findOne()` - Now includes project and developer relations
- `getPropertiesByLocation()` - Now includes project and developer relations

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema**

### **Properties Table Updates**
```sql
ALTER TABLE properties 
ADD COLUMN project_id VARCHAR(36) NULL,
ADD COLUMN developer_id VARCHAR(36) NULL;

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IDX_PROPERTIES_PROJECT_ID ON properties(project_id);
CREATE INDEX IDX_PROPERTIES_DEVELOPER_ID ON properties(developer_id);

-- Foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE properties 
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PROPERTIES_PROJECT 
FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE properties 
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PROPERTIES_DEVELOPER 
FOREIGN KEY (developer_id) REFERENCES developers(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

## üí° **Use Cases**

### **1. Property Search and Filtering**
- Find all properties in a specific project
- Find all properties by a specific developer
- Find properties by project and developer combination

### **2. Reporting and Analytics**
- Property distribution across projects
- Developer performance analysis
- Project completion status

### **3. User Experience**
- Property listings grouped by project
- Developer portfolio views
- Project-based property browsing

## üîí **Security & Multi-tenancy**

### **Data Isolation**
- All queries are filtered by `company_id`
- Users can only access properties from their company
- Project and developer access follows company boundaries

### **Permission Considerations**
- Properties can be linked to projects/developers within the same company
- Validation ensures data integrity across company boundaries

## üß™ **Testing**

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Create property with project and developer**
2. **Update property to change project/developer**
3. **Search properties by project**
4. **Search properties by developer**
5. **Search properties by project and developer**
6. **Verify multi-tenancy isolation**

### **Test Data Setup**
```typescript
// Create test data
const developer = await developersService.create({
  name: 'Test Developer',
  company_id: companyId,
  // ... other fields
});

const project = await projectsService.create({
  name: 'Test Project',
  company_id: companyId,
  developer_id: developer.id,
  // ... other fields
});

const property = await propertiesService.create({
  title: 'Test Property',
  company_id: companyId,
  project_id: project.id,
  developer_id: developer.id,
  // ... other fields
});
```

## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Data Integrity**
- Properties can exist without projects or developers (nullable fields)
- When a project is deleted, associated properties' `project_id` becomes NULL
- When a developer is deleted, associated properties' `developer_id` becomes NULL

### **Performance**
- New indexes on `project_id` and `developer_id` for fast queries
- Relations are loaded efficiently using TypeORM's query builder
- Consider pagination for large result sets

### **Migration Safety**
- Existing properties will have NULL values for new fields
- No data loss during migration
- Backward compatibility maintained

## üîÑ **Future Enhancements**

### **Planned Features**
1. **Property Cloning** - Copy properties across projects
2. **Bulk Operations** - Update multiple properties' project/developer
3. **Advanced Filtering** - Complex queries across projects and developers
4. **Property Templates** - Pre-defined property configurations per project type

### **Integration Points**
1. **Leads & Deals** - Link to specific properties/projects
2. **Activities** - Track property-related activities by project
3. **Analytics** - Enhanced reporting with project/developer dimensions
4. **Notifications** - Project and developer-specific alerts
